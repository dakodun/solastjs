      The following are small Apps created while developing SolastJS during
    feature implementation, testing or bug fixing. Each is only a simple
    example usually dealing with a specific topic but may contain code
    or ideas that are useful either for integration/regression testing,
    as a reference with regards to working with SolastJS, or perhaps as an
    example of a certain technique or implementation.
